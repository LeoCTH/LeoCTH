# 👋👩‍💻

*Heya~!* I'm **Leah (she/her)**, a Chinese open-source developer & designer currently based in Berlin, interested in making the world of digital technology and design more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

I'm currently one of the maintainers of [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), a new, modern terminal emulator written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), specializing in UI design and Linux platform support. I'm also a contributor/code reviewer of [NixOS and Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), and have contributions in various projects under [nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community). I also made some minor side projects in Rust, including a crate that allows one to [write KRunner plugins in Rust](https://github.com/pluiedev/krunner-rs), as well as some website design work for open-source projects.

I like to keep my profile page on GitHub brief as I often forget that it even exists. You can find out more about me on [my personal website](https://pluie.me/), which might contain more up-to-date information 💜
