### Hi there 👋
I currently develop Minecraft mods, of my own and with [@ReMod-Studios](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios) and [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** my own mods (see pinned) and [DashLoader](https://github.com/alphaqu/DashLoader) with [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** the dark wizardry of advanced Rust and repulsive hacks with JVMs

- :book: **I like and often use** Kotlin, Rust and Ruby; I sometimes use Java for modding stuff but I think Kotlin's a lot better.
