*Heya~!* I'm **Leah (she/her)**, a Chinese open-source developer currently based in Berlin, interested in making the world of digital technology and design more accessible and inclusive for everyone. However, most of what I've made often ends up being silly programs and utilities for my own entertainment ~~and masochist desires~~, which shows that not everyone is perfect :p

I code primarily in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and I maintain a couple of open-source Rust projects that I hope are useful for other people:
- A [Rust port of the package conversion tool, `alien`;](https://github.com/pluiedev/alien)
- [`krunner-rs`](https://github.com/pluiedev/krunner-rs), a library that allows people to write [KRunner](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner) plugins easily in pure Rust;
- [`krunner-nix`](https://github.com/pluiedev/krunner-nix), a KRunner plugin using the aforementioned library that suggests programs that can be installed with [Nix](https://nixos.org/), the declarative and reproducible package manager;
- [And much more!]()

In addition to Rust, for web development projects, I also make heavy use of [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and other components of the JS ecosystem. [My personal website](https://pluie.me), powered by [Lume](https://lume.land), is probably the best example I have so far, though I have also spent a large amount of time and effort in designing [the homepage of QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org), of which I was formerly a developer.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) as my operating system of choice, and extensively use declarative configurations to make my systems reliable and reproducible. [Check out my flake here!](https://github.com/pluiedev/flake)

If you want to contact me (questions, suggestions, complaints, or even just asking how well I'm doing :3), there's a list of contact information available on [my website](https://pluie.me).
