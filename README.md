### Hi there 👋
I code things.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** Minecraft mods and indie games, of my own and with [@ReMod-Games](https://github.com/ReMod-Games) and [@QuantumFusionMC](https://github.com/QuantumFusionMC)

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** the dark wizardry of advanced Rust, repulsive hacks with JVMs, bytecode manipulation and Vulkan

- :book: **My preferences on programming languages:**
    - Tier A: Kotlin for general use, Rust when speed and safety is required, and Ruby for versatile tinkering.
    - Tier B: TypeScript for web dev, Java for Minecraft modding sometimes (but Kotlin's a lot better), Python for AI and data analysis.
    - Tier C: C/C++ when I'm drunk and/or want to self-flagellate 
    - Tier F: JavaScript (No. Just use TypeScript; TS has fixed most things I hate about JS and I recommend you to replace JS from your brain entirely with TS)

- 📫 **How to reach me:**
    - My Discord server where I hang out and post updates: [here](https://discord.gg/NeNfePzCx8)
    - Alternatively, you can also contact me directly via Discord `leocth#3409` (friend requests and DMs open)
    - Or my email linked in the profile page (I don't check that often though)

- 😄 **Pronouns:** he/him (they if you must)

- 🕙 **Timezone:** China Standard Time (UTC+8)

- 🗨️ **Languages I speak/use:** English/简体中文

- ⚡ Fun fact: this page took me like 15 minutes to fill out
