### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I currently develop Minecraft mods, of my own and with [@ReMod-Studios](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios) and [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** [Luminous Depths](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios/lumidep-java) and [datakenesis](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios/datakenesis) for [ReMod](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios), and a secretâ„¢ project with [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** the dark wizardry of advanced Rust and repulsive hacks with JVMs

- :book: **I like and often use** Kotlin, Rust and Ruby; I sometimes use Java for modding stuff but I think Kotlin's a lot better.

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** via Discord `leocth#3409` (friend requests and DMs open), or my email linked in the profile page

- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: this page took me like 15 minutes to fill out
