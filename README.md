# 👋👩‍💻

*Heya~!* I'm **Leah (she/her)**, a Chinese open-source developer currently based in Berlin, interested in making the world of digital technology and design more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

I'm currently one of the maintainers of [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), a new, modern terminal emulator written in Zig, and a contributor/code reviewer of [NixOS and Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

I like to keep my profile page on GitHub brief as I often forget that it even exists. You can find out more about me on [my personal website](https://pluie.me/), which might contain more up-to-date information 💜
